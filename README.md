This project is about analyzing customer transaction data to understand buying patterns,EDA and visualization.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
In this project,I worked with real life transaction data and performed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).The main focus was to syudy how Quantity,UnitPrice and TotalPrice values are related.

## WHAT I DID :
